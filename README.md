[Get an API key](https://www.nexscope.ai/seller/api-access?co-from=github-ecommerce-api) · [Official API docs](https://www.nexscope.ai/api-docs?co-from=github-ecommerce-api) · [Complete catalog](#complete-api-catalog) · [Integration guide](docs/calling-apis.md)

This repository includes documentation for every API in the official directory, request/response definitions, editable request samples, and cURL, JavaScript, and Python clients. Use it to connect marketplace research, sourcing, keyword analysis, product imagery, and video creation to your application.

## Quick start

### 1. Get and configure your API key

Open [API Access](https://www.nexscope.ai/seller/api-access?co-from=github-ecommerce-api), sign in, and create or copy your user API key. Send it in the `Authorization` header as a bearer token.

Creative API access requires an active subscription. Trial credits do not enable Creative API key access. Review your account access and [current plans](https://www.nexscope.ai/pricing?co-from=github-ecommerce-api) before submitting generation requests.

Keep the key on your server. Do not commit it or expose it in a browser application. In Bash or Zsh, enter it without displaying it or putting its value into shell history:

```bash
printf 'Nexscope API key: '
read -r -s NEXSCOPE_API_KEY
printf '\n'
export NEXSCOPE_API_KEY
```

All run requests use:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

### 2. Make your first Data API request

This example calls [Amazon Search API](docs/data/amazon-search.md) for `phone case` results. It sends a real API request when you execute it with your key.

```bash
curl --silent --show-error --fail-with-body --max-time 120 \
  -X POST 'https://api.nexscope.ai/api/skill-api/v1/skills/amazon-search/run' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $NEXSCOPE_API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"keyword":"phone case","page":1}'
```

A successful HTTP response contains the API-specific payload directly. For Amazon Search, inspect fields such as `products` and `total`; do not assume an extra `data` or `result` wrapper. [Documented response fixture](examples/responses/amazon-search.json).

### 3. Use JavaScript, Python, or reusable cURL commands

Clone this repository and run commands from its root. The examples require Node.js 22+, Python 3.10+, or cURL 7.76+; the cURL helper also uses Python 3.10+ to look up and check the request. JavaScript and Python use only standard libraries.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexscope-ai/nexscope-ecommerce-api.git
cd nexscope-ecommerce-api

# Choose ONE client to submit a request:
node examples/javascript/run.mjs amazon-search payloads/amazon-search.json
# Alternatively:
python3 examples/python/run.py amazon-search payloads/amazon-search.json
# Alternatively:
bash examples/curl/run.sh amazon-search payloads/amazon-search.json
```

Each command above independently submits a request. To inspect the method, endpoint, and JSON without sending or using credits:

```bash
python3 examples/python/run.py amazon-search payloads/amazon-search.json --dry-run
node examples/javascript/run.mjs amazon-search payloads/amazon-search.json --dry-run
```

[JavaScript source](examples/javascript/run.mjs) · [Python source](examples/python/run.py) · [cURL source](examples/curl/run.sh)

### 4. Call a Creative API and retrieve its result

All 53 Creative APIs in this snapshot use asynchronous tasks. This example uses [Background Remover API](docs/creative/background-remover.md).

Create a request with **your real, publicly accessible image URL**. The input image must meet the API's documented limits, including 385–8192 pixels on both dimensions and a maximum size of 20 MB.

```bash
cp payloads/background-remover.json creative-request.json
# Edit creative-request.json: replace the example.com image URL with your asset URL.
# subType: 1 = general, 2 = portrait, 3 = product, 9 = apparel, 12 = hair, 13 = face.

python3 examples/python/run.py background-remover creative-request.json > creative-task.json
cat creative-task.json
```

The submission returns a receipt resembling this **illustrative documentation sample**:

```json
{
  "taskId": "6b3f1c61-1b7d-4a59-8a7d-3b23e4b0c9e2",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "message": "The task has been created. Use taskId to query the result."
}
```

Use the task ID returned by **your own request** to query the result; do not rerun the POST to check progress:

```bash
TASK_ID=$(python3 -c 'import json; print(json.load(open("creative-task.json"))["taskId"])')
python3 examples/python/run.py background-remover --task "$TASK_ID"
# Alternatively: node examples/javascript/run.mjs background-remover --task "$TASK_ID"
# Alternatively: bash examples/curl/run.sh background-remover --task "$TASK_ID"
```

The query endpoint is:

```http
GET https://api.nexscope.ai/api/skill-api/v1/skills/background-remover/tasks/{taskId}
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

- `PENDING` or `RUNNING`: the task is not complete. Query the same task later; a 5-second starting interval is an application recommendation, not an API rate-limit guarantee.
- `SUCCESS`: inspect the returned payload for generated outputs and the actual credits charged.
- `FAILED` or `TIMEOUT`: stop polling and inspect the error. A new submission is a separate request.

The included clients perform one submission or one status check per command. They do not automatically resubmit or poll indefinitely. See [asynchronous integration details](docs/calling-apis.md#asynchronous-creative-apis).

### 5. Switch to any API in the catalog

Open its documentation below, copy `payloads/<slug>.json` into your own request file, and replace illustrative inputs. Pass the slug and your file to the same client:

```bash
cp payloads/seedance-2-5-video-generation.json request.json
# Edit request.json with your real reference image and desired prompt.
python3 examples/python/run.py seedance-2-5-video-generation request.json
```

Parameter names, media requirements, conditional fields, and response shapes vary by API. The clients reject reserved example-domain asset URLs; you must also review sample product IDs, search terms, and other values for your intended use.

## Errors and response handling

| HTTP status | What to do |
|---|---|
| 200 | Parse the API-specific response; for asynchronous work, also inspect task status. |
| 400 | Check required fields, types, allowed values, conditional inputs, and media constraints. |
| 401 | Check the bearer header and API key. |
| 403 | Check account permissions, API access, and subscription requirements. |
| 429 | Respect `Retry-After` when present and back off. |
| 5xx | Inspect the service error. Before resubmitting a generation request, check whether a task was created. |

The helpers surface non-2xx responses. The Python and JavaScript helpers also exit with an error for `FAILED` or `TIMEOUT` task states; cURL reports HTTP status only. Do not blindly retry POST requests: the documentation does not establish an idempotency guarantee.

## Source, coverage, and validation

Snapshot: **2026-09-10**, from the [official API directory](https://www.nexscope.ai/api-docs?co-from=github-ecommerce-api) and its public definition service. Counts refer to documented API entries, not every supporting HTTP route. The complete 225-entry inventory is included; live documentation can change after this snapshot.

Some definitions use field descriptors rather than standard JSON Schema. Each format is labeled in the catalog. Published request and response samples are illustrative fixtures, not evidence of successful live calls. No authenticated or billable API requests were executed to prepare this repository. See [source notes](docs/source-notes.md) for the precise validation scope.

Run the offline consistency checks:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_catalog.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
node --check examples/javascript/run.mjs
