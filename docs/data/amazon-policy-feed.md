## Call this API

Run these commands from the repository root after [setting your API key](../../README.md#1-get-and-configure-your-api-key).

# Edit request.json for your inputs.
bash examples/curl/run.sh amazon-policy-feed request.json
# Or: node examples/javascript/run.mjs amazon-policy-feed request.json

### Published request example

```json
{
  "site": "US",
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 20
}
```

## Response

The run endpoint returns its API-specific payload directly. Do not assume a `data` or `result` wrapper. For asynchronous APIs, the run response is a task receipt, not the final generated asset.
