Run a catalogued Amazon Ads entity operation.

[All APIs](../../README.md#complete-api-catalog) · [Official documentation](https://www.nexscope.ai/api-docs/amazon-ads-manager?view=api&co-from=github-ecommerce-api)

Category: Amazon Advertising · Data API

Accepts only documented ads_manager.sb/sd/sp operation IDs. Provider methods and paths are derived server-side; mutations require preview followed by confirmation.

## Endpoint

`POST https://api.nexscope.ai/api/skill-api/v1/skills/amazon-ads-manager/run`

Headers: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` and `Content-Type: application/json`.

Execution: synchronous; inspect the direct API-specific response body.

## Request parameters

|---|---|---|---|---|

### Published request example

```json
{
  "connectionId": 123,
  "operationId": "sp.list_campaigns",
  "payload": {}
}
```

## Response

The run endpoint returns its API-specific payload directly. Do not assume a `data` or `result` wrapper. For asynchronous APIs, the run response is a task receipt, not the final generated asset.

### Published response example

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "confirmationToken": "opaque-token",
  "expiresAt": "1760000000000"
}
```
