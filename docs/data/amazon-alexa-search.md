# Amazon Alexa Search API

Initiate natural language Q&A through Amazon's storefront Alexa shopping assistant to get shopping guidance answers, recommended product groups, ASIN lists, and follow-up questions. Each call supports only 1 prompt; for follow-ups, the agent must summarize context and concatenate a new question for a new request. A url can be used to supplement Amazon page context.

## Endpoint

Headers: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` and `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Request parameters

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `prompts` | array | Yes | Conversation prompt array, supports only 1 entry. Each call accepts only 1 question. For follow-up questions, the agent must summarize key information from the previous response (recommended products, ASINs, key conclusions, etc.), concatenate it with the new question, and send it as a new prompts[0]. Each call is an independent new session and does not retain cross-call conversation history | {} |
| `format` | string | No | Response format: markdown (default) returns a readable report; json returns a structured data array | {} |
| `url` | string | No | Linked page URL, used to supplement the page context of Alexa's current response. Only pass this when the user provides a specific page (category page / search results page / product detail page, etc.); do not pass this parameter for the Amazon homepage (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/) | {} |

  "format": "markdown",
  "prompts": [
    "What are good phone cases for iPhone?"
  ]
}
```

## Response

The run endpoint returns its API-specific payload directly. Do not assume a `data` or `result` wrapper. For asynchronous APIs, the run response is a task receipt, not the final generated asset.
