```

## Response

The run endpoint returns its API-specific payload directly. Do not assume a `data` or `result` wrapper. For asynchronous APIs, the run response is a task receipt, not the final generated asset.

### Published response example

```json
{
  "errmsg": "ok",
  "columns": [],
  "errcode": 200,
  "items": [],
  "total": 0
