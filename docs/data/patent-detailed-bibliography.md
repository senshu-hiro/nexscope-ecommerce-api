## Call this API

Run these commands from the repository root after [setting your API key](../../README.md#1-get-and-configure-your-api-key). Copy the sample to a separate file and replace illustrative URLs, IDs, search terms, and required values before submitting. Sample responses are documentation fixtures, not live results.

```bash
cp payloads/patent-detailed-bibliography.json request.json
# Edit request.json for your inputs.
bash examples/curl/run.sh patent-detailed-bibliography request.json
# Or: node examples/javascript/run.mjs patent-detailed-bibliography request.json

### Published request example

```json
{
  "patentNumber": "US11299876B2"
}
```

## Response

The run endpoint returns its API-specific payload directly. Do not assume a `data` or `result` wrapper. For asynchronous APIs, the run response is a task receipt, not the final generated asset.
